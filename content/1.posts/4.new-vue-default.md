# The New Vue Default 

Important notice: Vue will become default version on February 7, 2022

I am actually excited about the current direction and vision that Vue is headed. Being a progressive framework means that implementation of how code is written is paramount for developer experience (DX). Look at how the new vue is implemented.

```
npm install init vue/@latest
```
This provides a refreshing CLI experience that runs on Vite tooling under the hood. Integrating all the relevant tools from the community make the experience worth while..... just wish there was an turn off the bloatware (for more experienced persons who wanna get up and running quickly)
