## Performance 

Nuxt.js provides some unique advantages which allowed for it to be the main choice when creating my website. Vue.js is my framework of choice in most cases. Nuxt.js provides an "intutitve" developer experience (DX). Nuxt.js has zero configuration, allowing for file-system routing, components auto-import and seo friendly for indexing. Paramount to this application using the power modules- Content, that allows for my web app to using MDX for this blog section.

## Future Updates

Addition of Youtube videos section will added shortly, Integration of Twitch API....
